# Product Intelligence (PI) MVP

A static proof-of-concept demonstration of a structured decision framework that helps individuals, businesses, and sellers understand products before buying, selling, or sourcing. This MVP showcases the core innovation—a repeatable, auditable 9-section template that standardises product evaluation—without requiring automation, AI processing, or live data.
